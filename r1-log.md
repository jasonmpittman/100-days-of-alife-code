# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jason M. Pittman

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 11th, Wednesday, 2017].

## Log

### D1R1 
Worked on a text-based L-System generator in Python. The rule input, rule processor, and seed input all work. Finish tomorrow with L-System engine. Need to complete the README too.

### D2R1
Continued work on the text-based L-System generator. Got the main generator loop stubbed and the logic of the system engine designed. Finish the generator tonight.

### D3R1
Updated the challenge README and this log markdown. L-System generator main and rule processors completed. Need to revise the system engine.

### D4R1
Completed the text-based L-System generator. Tested with A -> B; B -> ABA ruleset. Learned about the *global* keyword in python. Onto the next ALife programming project!

### D5R1
Started a simple graphical L-System generator in Python. Studied *turtle* drawing and implemented tkinter in local dev environment. Developed generator function outline.

### D6R1
Continued working on simple graphical L-System generator. Expanded on the graphics system using Turtle. Resolved a few bugs in syntax.

### D7R1
More or less completed the simple graphical L-System generator. Faithfully renders a classic l-system example (included rule as a comment). Started looking at the next project in the challenge.

### D8R1
Long travel day. Worked on code outline for the next challenge project which is a simple boolean cellular automata.

### D9R1
Finished boolean CA seed processor function and number of generations to run function. Fixed tab/space indentation issue. Need to get finish the graphical L-System project tomorrow.

### D10R1 - D12R1
Worked on boolean CA code intermittently during conference. Also worked on L-System turtle engine a little. Read about general artificial life algorithms for more advanced cellular automata theory.

### D13R1
Continued working on boolean CA. Built rough outline for rules engine and refined seed and generation inputs functions. Coding on travel is challenging.

### D14R1 
Worked on boolean CA and simple graphical L-system. Boolean ca just needs rules and L-System needs to compute final string for the turtle to eat.

### D15R1
Decided that manually retweeting on the #100DaysOfCode hashtag was an opportunity for automation. Programmed a python retweet bot that catches the hashtag and randomly selects a response. 

###D16-17R1
Finished python-based retweet-bot that searches for #100DaysOfCode hashtag and 'retweets' with a randomly selected comment. Tested and validated execution. Updated README with basic instructions. Now, back to Artificial Life!

###D18R1
Finished simple graphical L-System using python and turtle drawing. Maybe in the future I'll work on an engine that is char agnostic but for now the A, B, -, + drawing system works fine to illustrate the L-System concept.

###D20R1
